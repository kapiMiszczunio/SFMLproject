# MineSweeper Game

Minesweeper is a logic puzzle video game genre generally played on personal computers. The game features a grid of clickable squares, with hidden "mines" scattered throughout the board. The objective is to clear the board without detonating any mines, with help from clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field. We created this game using Object-Oriented Programming in c++ and we followed rules of the MVC software designing pattern. Game pop ups in windows which are built using basic methods nad classes from SFML module.
